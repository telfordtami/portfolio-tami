        <p style="font-family:TimesNewRoman">LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector
            General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical
            intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

        <p style="font-family:TimesNewRoman">According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the
            most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due
            to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

        <p style="font-family:TimesNewRoman">CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public
            will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
        <ul style="font-family:TimesNewRoman">
            <li>the Cold War</li>
            <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
            <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
